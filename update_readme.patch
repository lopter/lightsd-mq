 Use the ``-f`` option to run lightsd in the foreground.
 
+Known issues
+------------
+
+The grouping (tagging) code of the LIFX White 800 is bugged: after a tagging
+operation the LIFX White 800 keep saying it has no tags. Reboot the bulb to make
+the tags appears.
+
+Power ON/OFF are the only commands with auto-retry, i.e: lightsd will keep
+sending the command to the bulb until its state changes. This is not implemented
+(yet) for ``set_light_from_hsbk`` and ``set_waveform``.
+
+While lighsd appears to be pretty stable, if you want to run lightsd in the
+background, I recommend doing it in a processor supervisor (e.g: Supervisor_)
+that can restart lightsd in case of crash. Otherwise, please send me your crash
+reports!
