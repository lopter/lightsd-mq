+Build instructions for Debian/Ubuntu (dpkg based sytems)
+--------------------------------------------------------

+
+Install the following requirements:
+
+::
+
+   build-essential cmake libevent-dev git ca-certificates ipython3 fakeroot wget devscripts debhelper
+
+Download and extract the release:
+
+.. code-block:: sh
+
+   wget -O lightsd_1.0.1.orig.tar.gz https://github.com/lopter/lightsd/archive/1.0.1.tar.gz
+   tar -xzf lightsd_1.0.1.orig.tar.gz
+   cd lightsd-1.0.1
+   wget -O - https://github.com/lopter/lightsd/releases/download/1.0.1/dpkg-1.0.1.tar.gz | tar -xzf -

+   debuild
+
+Install the package8

+   root already.
+
+.. code-block:: sh
+
+   dpkg -i ../lightsd_1.0.1_`uname -r | cut -d- -f 3`.tar.gz
